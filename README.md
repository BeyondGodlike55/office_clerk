# rubyclerks/office_clerk

A ruby translation project managed on [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) that's open to all!

## Contributing to rubyclerks/office_clerk

- Edit the translations directly on the [rubyclerks/office_clerk](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=rubyclerks/office_clerk) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

Happy translating!
