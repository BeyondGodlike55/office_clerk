Office Clerk is the back office helper, your accountant, storage manager, secretary and more. It is the heart of the [RubyClerks team](http://rubyclerks.org) , the manager as it were.

####  Status

In production for 2 sites. Work continues on refinements. That could qualify for 1.0 but i'll wait a few months. 

### Other clerks

The original plan (as per web-site) is being implemented: several extension "clerk" will be optional. Some are ready (one not)

### AccountantClerk

This currenly does graphical sales reports. Purchase order creation is planned.

### Print Clerk

A invoice generator. Also barcode generation and receipt printing (for POS use).

### Sales Clerk

We have a shop [online](http://auringostaitaan.fi/), the best way to get started is to clone [it](https://github.com/rubyclerks/sales_clerk).

### Getting Started

The easy way (tryout or new project):

- clone sales_clerk
- bundle and migrate it
- change the git/config 
- start editing

The longer route, adding to existing project

- add office_clerk  to Gemfile (gem or git)
- build your public pages
- possibly copy ShopController from sales_clerk as a starting point
