# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
# For example, setting:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: Your_Gmail_Clerkname
# makes 'Your_Gmail_Clerkname' available as ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]

# Add application configuration variables here, as shown below.

ADMIN_NAME: First Clerk
ADMIN_EMAIL: user@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD: changeme
